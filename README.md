Car Rental Agency
1. Assume you are designing a real-life system that will be used by real users.
2. The application should contain 2 types of users: Customers and Car Rental Agency
3. Pages to be developed-
● ‘Registration’ pages - Different registration pages for customers & car rental agencies.

● ‘Login’ pages - Single/different login pages for customers & car rental agencies.


● ‘Add new cars’ page - A Car rental agency once logged in, should be able to add details
of new cars available for rental. 

Details to add
○ Vehicle model, Vehicle number, seating capacity, rent per day
Access to this page should be restricted only to the car rental agency. Car rental
agencies should also be able to edit the details of a particular car


● ‘Available cars to rent’ page - There should be a page that displays all the available
cars to rent. 

Details to display -
○ Vehicle model, Vehicle number, seating capacity, rent per day

○ Capture input as dropdown for the number of days the customer need to rent the
car (This input only be shown when the customer is logged in)


○ Capture start date (This input only be shown when the customer is logged in)


○ ‘Rent Car’ button.
This page should be accessible to everyone, irrespective of whether the user is logged in
or not. 
Expected functionality on click of the ‘Rent Car’ button-
○ Only customers should be able to book the available car by clicking the ‘Rent
Car’ button.

○ If the customer is not logged in, then he/she should be redirected to the login
page.

○ If a user is logged in as an agency, then the user should not be allowed to book
the available car
